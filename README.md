# Sys200_Team2
This is a collaboration for a team project in which we need to be able to:

The ability to call a separate file where the username and hash of the users password is stored (like /etc/shadow).
Neither the username nor password/hashed password can be in the python file.
The separate file must be only readable and writable by root. No other permissions can be set.

PEP-8 Standards​ 
At least 3 Validation Functions​
A Try/Except Statement​
The Ability to Log information of any type and must include Logging Levels​
The Ability to access a separate file where the user/hash is stored.
